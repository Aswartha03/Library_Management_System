A Library Management System (LMS) is a software application designed to manage and streamline the operations of a library. It helps librarians and users efficiently handle day-to-day tasks such as cataloging books, managing member information, issuing and returning books, tracking overdue items, and generating reports.
Key Features of a Library Management System : 
1 . Book Management
The system stores information about books including title, author, publisher, edition, category, and availability. It allows easy addition, updating, and removal of books from the database.
2. Member Management
It maintains records of library members including their personal details, membership status, and borrowing history.
3.Issue and Return Process
The system tracks when a member borrows or returns a book, automatically updating availability. It helps in sending alerts for overdue books and calculating fines.
4.Security and Access Control
It restricts access based on user roles (e.g., librarian or member) to ensure that only authorized users can perform certain actions.

Applications

Library management systems are used in schools, colleges, universities, public libraries, corporate libraries, and private institutions. They ensure that libraries operate smoothly, books are well-managed, and users can access resources easily.
